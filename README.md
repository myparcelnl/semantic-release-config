This package contains multiple semantic-release presets. Additional information, documentation and guides on
semantic-release can be found on https://eslint.org/

## Usage

Install the package via yarn:

```
yarn add -D @myparcel/semantic-release-config
```

or npm:

```
npm i -D @myparcel/semantic-release-config
```

Create a [semantic-release config file], if you haven't already, and add the following: (JavaScript example)

```js
// release.config.js
module.exports = {
  extends: '@myparcel/semantic-release-config',
};
```

Or to use one of the other available presets:

```js
// release.config.js
module.exports = {
  extends: '@myparcel/semantic-release-config/npm',
};
```

## Debugging

You can run the following command in your project to test your semantic-release configuration:

```shell
npx semantic-release --dry-run --debug --branches=$(git branch --show-current)
```

Flags used:

- `--dry-run`: If this is on, no files are changed and nothing is actually "released".
- `--debug`: Enables debug mode to show a lot more output.
- `--branches`: Set the current branch as a release branch. If you don't pass this and are not on a release branch
  semantic-release will not process your commits.
